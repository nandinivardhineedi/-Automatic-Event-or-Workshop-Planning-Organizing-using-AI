## 📚 College Workshop Automation – Built with n8n & Google Workspace

This project automates the end-to-end workflow of organizing academic workshops in colleges using a **no-code/low-code approach**. It leverages **n8n** as the automation engine, integrated with **Google Sheets, Docs, Slides, and Gmail**, to reduce manual work and improve efficiency for faculty and event coordinators.

### 🔧 Features

* Accepts workshop details via a webhook form
* Stores and organizes data in **Google Sheets**
* Auto-generates approval request letters using **Google Docs**
* Sends approval and information emails through **Gmail**
* Creates event posters dynamically in **Google Slides**
* Tracks participants and event updates in real time

### 🧠 Real Use Case

This workflow was first deployed during the **“AI Automation” workshop** conducted at **SITE, Tadepalligudem**, organized by **Nandini Vardhineedi** with **Narayani (Senior Developer, Autodesk)** as the keynote speaker.

The system handled everything — from form submissions to email approvals, document generation, poster creation, and participant tracking — without any manual steps.
